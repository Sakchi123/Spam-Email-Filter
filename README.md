# Spam-Email-Filter

The main idea of this project is to detect the spam emails. We will use machine learning technique (Natural Language Processing) to train our email spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and no-spam. With Natural Language Processing, our machine can make sense of written text and perform tasks including speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and automatic text summarization. Also, we will be building a binary classification model to detect whether an email message is spam.
Programming Language Used: Python 3.0 or higher.
